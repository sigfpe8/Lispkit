# The Lispkit

The book [Functional Programming Application and Implementation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5838062-functional-programming-application-and-implementation) by Peter Henderson was published in 1980 and may look a bit outdated after more than 40 years. However, I think it still provides a solid foundation for many concepts. I especially like his treatment of the SECD machine and associated compiler. In the final chapters of the book he describes in pseudo-Algol an implementation of such a virtual machine and an interpreter for a simple Lisp language he calls *Lispkit Lisp*. The whole system is known as the *Lispkit*.

This repository contains my implementation of the Lispkit in good old C. Actually it *will* contain an implementation someday. For now it has just part of if. Please come back later! ðŸ™‚
